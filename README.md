## YayConfig
This is the Server config System I originally made for ultracraft; Moved into a stand-alone Library and Updated to 1.21.1
I'm planning on using it for more of my mods. Others may use it as well, it's currently not really documented tho.

I currently don't have enough time to document it; I'll do that at some other time.

It's also not very tested; some of the features currently are.. sort of trust based. 
Again, time constraints and stuff and since those features aren't immediately required for me, I'll just leave them as is for now.
